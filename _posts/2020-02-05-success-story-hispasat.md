[Hispasat](https://www.hispasat.com/es/) is the leading Spanish communications satellite operator in the distribution market of Spanish and Portuguese content. Established in 1989, Hispasat offers coverage in America, Europe and North Africa, being the eighth operator in the world. Hispasat's satellite fleet allows the distribution of more than 1250 television and radio channels to more than thirty million homes, as well as broadband services in fixed and mobile environments. In addition, it is a key driver of the Spanish aerospace industry. 

Hispasat offers a wide variety of services that require complex and personalised customer service.

There are many areas involved (business, resources, technical and operations, legal, etc.) with the incentive of 24x7 service in various geographical areas with different time zones and languages (Spanish and Portuguese). Hispasat has two control centers (one in Arganda del Rey - Madrid and the other one in Rio de Janeiro under the name Hispamar) and service offices in Spain, Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. 


## Standardization and measurement: the keys to change

Hispasat had two ways of managing customer service: a call center and a web portal. From Arganda del Rey and from Rio de Janeiro, service request and customer service tickets are managed. In addition, the call centre is supported and managed by the rest of the group's areas. 

Up to this point, everything seems correct and functional. But all of us who work in IT and software, know that, the real action occurs behind the scenes. 

Behind the web portal, we found a complex architecture of different tools. From Arganda, SIGO (Service Desk tool) was being used for spatial capacity requests, Ticket-On for broadband requests and Microsoft Dynamics for CRM issues. Three different tools that had to integrate and communicate with each other and with the web portal. In addition, in the case of Hispamar in Rio de Janeiro, another fourth tool (Trouble Ticket) was used to manage incidents related to spatial and broadband capacity. 

This resulted on a lack of standardization between areas (with their respective consequences), difficulty in the area of service quality for obtaining metrics at a global level, constant problems connecting the diverse ticketing tools and difficulty in measuring KPIs to ensure proper customer service.

It was necessary to improve the system. This is how Hispasat discovered the benefits of Jira Service Desk. 

## Jira Service Desk as a bridge to all directions

Service Quality area was committed to improve and better understand the software behind customer requests with the firm decision to facilitate the work and communication between the areas, aware that this was the fundamental piece to improve the quality of their customer service. 

The new solution had to meet a series of essential requirements for Hispasat Group: high availability, customer portal, metrics reports and customization. Jira Service Desk covered them all. 

The solution included implementation and configuration of Jira Service Desk Data Center for 250 agents, along with Crowd Data Center, Confluence and a series of applications from the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/), including our app [excentia Admin Tools](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1219118/excentia-admin-tools-for-jira?hosting=datacenter&tab=overview). 

With Crowd, we got uninterrupted access to Jira Service Desk, even in case of hardware failures. excentia Admin Tools allowed the implementation of necessary post-functions for the complex workflow presented by Hispasat. The Scheduler app saves a lot of time creating repetitive tasks that can be better employed  on the final customer service. Finally, Power Data Base app allows the visualization and extraction of data for the business, feature requested by the quality area. 

At Jira Service Desk, we defined the service catalogue and its corresponding projects (customer service, spatial capacity, broadband, general services and ground segment), created the service portal with the required fields, configured the external apps and trained the teams in both Brazil and Spain in the correct use of the tools. Currently, we continue to accompany them on the path of improvement, adding new functionalities, maintaining and updating their complex system, offering specialized support and extending tools' capabilities. 


## Milestones and improvements achieved in customer service

At the tenth year anniversary [event](https://www.excentia.es/aniversario) of excentia, we were pleased to have Óscar Pérez Navarro, head of the quality department that has led this implementation. 
In his presentation, Óscar highlighted the improvements achieved after the implementation of Jira Service Desk and the entire suite of Atlassian products that revolve around it:

- Uniformity and standardization. Now all the teams work with the same tool, the same processes and the same resources. This allows for global improvement, facilitates collaboration and improves productivity in all areas. 

- The flexibility and ease with which customers used to contact Hispasat is maintained. Both through the call center, the portal and even by email (automating the creation of tickets)

- Key KPIs are now measurable: response times, resolution times and satisfaction. 

- General increase in service quality. Not only has quality been increased, but it has also been possible to parameterize and measure this improvement. Response and resolution times have been reduced, data can be extracted for Business Intelligence (top 5 causal customers, etc) so actions can be designed, and end customer satisfaction has been improved. 


Oscar also highlighted something very relevant for all those attending our event, and in short, for all those interested in working towards these improvements: a project manager is required to take responsibility for such a profound change and to define the requirements that the partner has to execute. But above all, if you want to obtain profitability from these implementations, you have to dedicate time to it. 


If you are prepared for this, at excentia we will listen to you and be ready to work together on a continuos improvement methodology.
