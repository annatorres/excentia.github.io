## What's new in version 2.2.1?
Recent release comes with a maintenance mode for Jira to meet admins demand. 

As [Atlassian Gold Solution Partners](https://www.excentia.es/atlassian) ourselves, we have experimented some issues when working on Jira installations for our customers. **An user introducing data whilst work on Jira is being done, could be a potential threat. An administrator working on configuration could affect Jira users work.** What about effectively communicating  that maintenance mode it's being carried on? 
This has been corroborated by marketplace customers' feedback, who asked for a way to communicate users that Jira is under maintenance on the right moment on the right place. 
That's why, we are happy to present **Maintenance Mode** as the newest excentia Admin Tools addition. 


**Maintenance Mode allows Jira admins to communicate maintenance work on Jira in an effective way. The communication will be shown on the right environment, avoiding uncomfortable situations.**

When an user tries to access Jira, a warning message will be shown and log in will be invalidated:

Moreover, Jira admins will be able to access Jira, but with a warning that Maintenance Mode it's being carried on.
