BigBuy (part of A4B Group), european wholesale leader and B2B dropshipping market referent, distributes more than 70.000 items. BigBuy it's an "all-in-one" supplier, offering a catalogue in 24 languages, logistics, B2B Shop, synchronization, resources, administration, shipping and after-sales support. 
A key element for its success, resides on a multichannel integration platform that brings together ecommerce softwares (Shopify, PrestaShop, Magento, WooCommerce), e-marketplaces (Amazon, AliExpress, ebay,etc.) and shopping engines.

The company completely transformed its work methodology due to the right use of the Atlassian Suite and the introduction of agile concepts, guided by excentia. Excellent results have been achieved: an increase in turnover, growth control and employee satisfaction.  

## What triggered BigBuy's need to adopt Atlassian tools?

Back in 2018, BigBuy was experiencing an uncontrolled growth. Consequences were an alarming lack of coordination between departments, email saturation for the top management people and multiple unfinished tasks.
Moreover, there wasn't a requirements process for the IT and developers crew, so colleagues from many departments used to ask for new versions and features. This resulted on multiple apps with multiple fixes and not a clear development path nor efficient methodology. Of course, development estimation times were completely broken.

Top Management realized that their tools and work methodology needed to be changed, in order to grow and sustain that growth. Their implication during the process has been a key element for the success of this implementation.

After a profound research on tools, team management and suppliers, BigBuy shouted out for help to excentia´s team as Atlassian suite offers solutions for all the teams (business & development) with specific tools for their needs and excentia, as Atlassian partner, was available and working in the same area.

## What solutions were implemented?

excentia led the implementation, configuration and training of the following Atlassian Tools on Cloud hosting: 

- Jira Core: it’s used for team management and interaction within the organization and other teams. Marketing & Comms, Top Management Board, Sales Teams, etc.,  all of them use Jira Core for collaboration and daily tasks.

- Jira Software & Bitbucket: development team adopted agile methodologies after excentia’s training. Nowadays, they follow a scrum framework and fully collaborate with other company departments. 

- Confluence: not only used by developers for documentation, but also by marketing & design to share resources and for management as where to look for all the information they need to be aware of (planning, meeting minutes…)

- OKRs: more recently BigBuy introduced OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and have reached an increase in performance and team motivation. 

## What results have been achieved?

Adoption of an agile methodology, backed up with Atlassian Tools have resulted in many benefits for BigBuy: 

- BigBuy’s growth is under control. They keep growing but on an escalated, measurable and positive way. 

- Workers are more motivated and more efficient.

- Management team and the CEO are astonished by the results achieved and consider the incorporation of Atlassian tools as a key company decision.

- Turnover has been increased. In 2016, with the use of Google & Microsoft solutions, they reached a turnover of 14.2 mill €. In 2018, after implementation of Jira and Confluence, they reached 40 mill € of turnover. 

In October 2019, Salvador Esteve (BigBuy CEO), shared all of this information in the final presentation of excentia’s 10-year-anniversary [event](https://www.excentia.es/aniversario). Speakers included VP of Marketing of SonarSource and Vlad Cavalcanti from Atlassian. 

Salvador highlighted the relevance of top management implication on the adoption of new tools and methodologies and all the evangelization excentia made to avoid the use of email and follow the guidance of agile methodologies. In Salva’s words:

> “We couldn’t work without Jira. It has been a structural change in our company. Nowadays, when I receive an email I specifically ask to create an issue in Jira for me to work on it”.
